# What do I do?

I use Python to solve any problem I have that I can solve with the computer and lately I am trying to learn how to use the library Pygame to use it for anything I can thing to use it for. I am starting remaking some classic games like breakout or a puzzle game. You find the repository of the first in ArkaPygame. There is also a snake clone and a little memory game called chimp memory. Now I am working on a simple app to take memos and convert them in different formats called pysnippets.
